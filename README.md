# Stockholm
Stockholm is a powerful and interactive notebook that demonstrates how to simulate stock price movements and portfolio performance using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Monte Carlo simulations. It also leverages basic machine learning (Ridge Regression) for portfolio weight optimization and compares simulated prices with real market data.

Key Features:

Single-stock simulation using GBM
Monte Carlo simulation with thousands of paths
Correlated multi-asset portfolio simulation
Machine learning (Ridge Regression) for portfolio weight prediction
Risk analysis with Value at Risk (VaR) and probability of loss
Real price comparison with simulated projections
