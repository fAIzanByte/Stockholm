Stockholm is a powerful and interactive notebook that demonstrates how to simulate stock price movements and portfolio performance using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Monte Carlo simulations. It also leverages basic machine learning (Ridge Regression) for portfolio weight optimization and compares simulated prices with real market data.
