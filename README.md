# Stockholm
Stockholm is a powerful and interactive notebook that demonstrates how to simulate stock price movements and portfolio performance using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and Monte Carlo simulations. It also leverages basic machine learning (Ridge Regression) for portfolio weight optimization and compares simulated prices with real market data.
Key Features:
Single-stock simulation using GBM

Monte Carlo simulation with thousands of paths

Correlated multi-asset portfolio simulation

Machine learning (Ridge Regression) for portfolio weight prediction

Risk analysis with Value at Risk (VaR) and probability of loss

Real price comparison with simulated projections
Structure:
Single Stock Simulation
Simulates a stock price path using GBM and compares it with the actual price over the past year.

Monte Carlo Simulation
Generates thousands of possible price paths for a stock to estimate risk metrics.

Portfolio Simulation with ML
Accepts multiple tickers, calculates returns and volatility, predicts optimal weights using Ridge Regression, and simulates future portfolio value with correlated asset modeling.
